                    People want to know the best deals in their areas, whether it be promotional sales, regional price differences,
                    or just finding the gas station with the cheapest price per gallon, our proposed app is the one-stop shop to find which areas have
                    the best prices in the county. Just open the app up, and the app will use your location to scrawl the web for the places with the cheapest prices,
                    and sort it out in a convenient, easy-to-read listing.
